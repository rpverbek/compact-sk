    "## Problem description: Gear pitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Gear pitting is a surface fatigue failure of the gear tooth. It occurs due to repeated loading of tooth surface and the contact stress exceeding the surface fatigue strength of the material. Material in the fatigue region gets removed and a pit is formed. The pit itself will cause stress concentration and soon the pitting spreads to adjacent region till the whole surface is covered [[source](https://gearsmechon.wordpress.com/pitting-of-gears/)].\n",

    "## Dataset description\n",
    "\n",
    "The **training** dataset includes measurements under varied operating conditions from a healthy state as well as six known fault levels. The **testing and validation** datasets contain data from eleven health levels. Data from some fault levels and operating conditions are excluded from the training datasets to mirror real-world conditions where data collection may only be available from a subset of full range of operation. The training data are collected from a range of different operating conditions under 15 different rotational speeds and 6 different torque levels. Test and validation data operating conditions span 18 different rotational speeds and 6 different torque levels.\n",
