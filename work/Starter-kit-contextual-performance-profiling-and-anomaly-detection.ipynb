    "## Business context\n",
    "Industry 4.0 leverages on the advanced AI technologies to enable anomaly detection and performance profiling of industrial assets operating in different contexts. Context is defined by both internal and external factors, such as operational conditions, environmental variables, and usage patterns. For this reason, context-aware methods are fundamental to identify anomalies and to ensure accurate and reliable asset profiling. These methods allow for real-time monitoring and enable enhanced performance and reduce downtime of assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The business goal related to this Starter Kit (SK) is to illustrate a data-driven methodology to identify anomalies and profile the performance of assets operating in different contexts, i.e. in terms of process measurements reflecting the internal operations of the asset.\n",
    "As data-driven methodology, this SK focuses on the methodology developed by Fingerhut et al. [[1](#fingerhut2023), [2](fingerhut2024)]. Conventional anomaly detection methods often detect anomalies when the operating conditions change, rendering them less applicable for real-world dynamic industrial use cases. In contrast, the methodology presented in this starterkit is suitable for these scenarios, because it considers the dynamic nature of operating conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "Contextual anomaly detection and performance profiling play a relevant role in a variety of industrial contexts such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Raise warnings to anticipate and avoid safety-critical conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alert the need for inspection to avoid possible downtime and cost corrective maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performance benchmarking\n",
    "\n",
    "**FFNG: Do we use double spacing between some bullet points (like the one above) on purpose.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data characteristics and requirements\n",
    "To showcase the SK, a dataset is required that includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The vibration frequency captured by asset sensors. The captured vibrations need to be related to the health state of the assets.\n",
    "- Parameters related to the internal operations of the asset."

Second, a description of data generated generated by the assets along with its preprocessing is reported. Third, the methodology introduced by [Fingerhut et al.

As an example we can imagine a gearbox that operates in two modes: normal and throttle. These two modes can be isolated by analzying the context, specifically the rotation speed of the gears. In throttle mode, the gearbox would operate under a reduced load, which would be indicated by a low rotational speed.\n",

This dataset collect the time series data from a gearbox subject to pitting, i.e. a fatigue failure of the gear tooth along with metadata. This dataset includes measurements under varied operating conditions from a healthy state as well as six known fault levels. The training data are collected from a range of different operating conditions under 15 different rotational speeds and 6 different torque levels.  For each operating condition, 5 vibration measurements were collected.\n",
    "The vibration data is given in the time domain with a sampling rate of 20480Hz. The sampling duration differs between 3 seconds and 12 seconds. For each vibration measurement there are triaxial time-domain vibration measurements available (x, y and z). The vibrations are collected at different rotation per minute (rpm) and different runs.  Below, the user can get acquainted with the [[dataset](https://data.phmsociety.org/phm2023-conference-data-challenge/)] by visualizing the vibration measurements in the three directions for different rpm and runs.

Each element in $\\mathbf{W}$ can be interpreted as the weights of the building blocks in $\\mathbf{H}$ needed to reconstruct a vibration signal encoded in the performance matrix $\\mathbf{V}$.\n",

Indeed, healthy gearboxes, the one with pitting level = 0, have offset close to 0 wherease faulty gearbox, the one with pitting level above 0, have higher offset. This is expected, as the context-sensitive fingerprint is derived from healthy data without pitting and data with pitting is likely to have vibration patterns not present in the healthy data set."

Therefore, we additionally tracked the TPR at a stable FPR of 0.1 (TPR@FPR=0.1, red dashed line), which represents the TPR when there are 10% false positives. In this scenario, the TPR would be 96%. An alternatve objective criterium is to keep the FPR as low as possible at a high TPR.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this SK is illustrated a data-driven methodology for contextual performance profiling and anomaly detection. The SK focuses on how to set up methodology parameters and correctly interpret its results. The methodology, validated on a gearbox that is subject to pitting, explains how to extract the contexts from an asset and how to use them to profile its performance. Furthermore, it proves that the performance profiles can be used to identify anomalies. For the latter, it has been shown that our method is able to detect most anomalies, while throwing few false alarms, as demonstrated through the ROC curve."
