    "Industry 4.0 leverages on the advanced AI technologies to enable anomaly detection and performance profiling of industrial assets operating in different contexts. Context is defined by both internal and external factors, such as operational conditions, environmental variables, and usage patterns. For this reason, context-aware methods are fundamental to identify anomalies and to ensure accurate and reliable asset profiling. These methods allow for real-time monitoring and enable enhanced performance and reduce downtime of assets.\n",

Conventional anomaly detection methods often detect anomalies when the operating conditions change, rendering them less applicable for real-world dynamic industrial use cases. In contrast, the methodology presented in this starterkit is suitable for these scenarios, because it considers the dynamic nature of operating conditions.\n",

In the rest of the document, we will only refer to this split to analyze the performance of the methodology for the sake of the computational time. However, to have more reliable results, multiple splits should be performed, i.e. multiple random samples should be extracted for the training and testing sets.

    "2. **Anomaly condition**: Vibration data characterized by pitting level 1-8 (two more than in the training set). For each level of pitting, there are between 267 and 304 samples in the test set that were recorded at different speeds and torques.\n",

If this is the case, should they not be removed even from the training set? --> FFNG: As a result of the random train-test split, some of the operating modes only occur in the test set (let's take for instance all measurements at 500 rpm and 100 Nm).

    "In this step, we extract for each asset its characteristic **performance behaviour**. These are extracted by applying a _non-negative matrix factorization_ (NMF) [[3](#nmf)] to the performance matrix V. The NMF method approximates a given matrix with two lower-dimensional matrices. The approximation contains the essential information about the asset's performance. Hence, NMF reveals underlying patterns in the performance data by representing it in a simpler form.\n",

The matrix $\\mathbf{W}$ contains the weights for reconstructing the original performance matrix $\\mathbf{V}$. Each element in $\\mathbf{W}$ can be interpreted as the weights of the building blocks in $\\mathbf{H}$ needed to reconstruct a vibration signal encoded in the performance matrix $\\mathbf{V}$.\n",

    "To decide the value $h$ of components we decompose the matrix into an increasing number of components. In the next code section, we apply the NMF to up to 50 components.

    "This phase can be divided in five steps (See Figure above). The main goals of these phases can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Windowing incoming streaming**. Streaming data is usually divided into batches. This activity is generally performed to avoid processing each new received data point as it arrives. However, since the data isn't streaming in this case, windowing isn't needed, so this step is skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Detecting of the operating context**. Each time stamp is associated with an operating mode which was identified during the offline phase. In this use case, operating modes are linked to vibration measurements without time stamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Deriving the performance profiles**. Each vibration measurement is characterized in terms of the vibration components that were extracted in step 1 during the offline phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Estimating the fingerprint offset**. For each vibration measurement, the _offset_ is calculated between the online profiles and the offline fingerprints. The offset quantifies to what extent the observed vibration behaviour differs from the expected vibration behaviour expressed through the fingerprints.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Deriving alarms**. In the original paper [[2](#fingerhut2024)], based on the offset, an anomaly score is computed for each time stamp. This score is monitored over time raise alarms. In this use case, the monitoring of the anomaly score is not possible since the timestamps in the test set are not ordered. For this reason, this step is skipped.\n",

    "The goal of extracting the performance profiles is to capture and represent the key characteristics of the vibration signal in a way that reflects the asset's vibration behavior. Therefore, this step essentially mirrors the step 1 of the offline phase, with the exception that the vibration components are not derived again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance profiles approximate the vibration signal in terms of the representative vibration components that were extracted during step 1 of the offline phase. Similarly to this step, the approximation contains the essential information about the asset's performance.\n",
    "These profiles are extracted by applying NMF to the processed vibration measurements from the online phase, denoted as $\\mathbf{v}'$.\n",
    "The processed measurements $\\mathbf{v}'$ are a vector with the same number of elements as the columns in the performance matrix $\\mathbf{V}$. Since the step is applied to a data stream, multiple samples are no longer stacked together as in $\\mathbf{V}$ during the offline phase.\n",

    "whether the performance of asset $i$ ($i = 1, . . . , n$) is normal or anomalous, it is necessary to quantify the distance - offset - between the observed and expected fingerprints. For this reason, for each performance measurement, the cosine distance between the derived weights $\\mathbf{w}'$ and the fingerprint $f_{ij} \\in F_i$, corresponding to the detected operating mode $O_{ij}$, ($j = 1, . . . , k_i$), is used to estimate the offset:\n",

The weight vectors are appended into a single ($3\\times h$)-dimensional vector $\\mathbf{w}_i'$  of rank 1 that is compared to the fingerprint $f_{1j}$ of the corresponding operating mode $O_{1j}$.\n",

For this reason in next code section, for each operating mode are computed the offset of the derived weights to the corresponding fingerprint.

An alternatve objective criterium is to keep the FPR as low as possible at a high TPR.\n",

    "## 4. Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this SK is illustrated a data-driven methodology for contextual performance profiling and anomaly detection. The SK focuses on how to set up methodology parameters and correctly interpret its results. The methodology, validated on a gearbox that is subject to pitting, explains how to extract the contexts from an asset and how to use them to profile its performance. Furthermore, it proves that the performance profiles can be used to identify anomalies. For the latter, it has been shown that our method is able to detect most anomalies, while throwing few false alarms, as demonstrated through the ROC curve."
